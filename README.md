## Model Deployment
![](https://github.com/sudhanshu2198/Machine-Learning-Python/blob/main/images/titanic.gif)

Deploying the trained model as an Web App utilizing streamlit that takes input and output prediction in real time. This makes the modelâ€™s predictions available to users, developers or systems, so they can make business decisions based on data, visualization and interact with their application.

## Imbalanced Dataset
![](https://github.com/sudhanshu2198/Machine-Learning-Python/blob/main/images/1.png)

Imbalanced data refers to those types of datasets where the target class has an uneven distribution of observations, i.e one class label has a very high number of observations and the other has a very low number of observations. **Any usual approach to solving this kind of machine learning problem often yields inappropriate results**. The projects would utilize different technique to tackle imbalanced dataset like cost-sensitive learning, data snampling using imblearn library (undersampling of majority class, oversampling of minority class), appropriate evaluation metrics like precision recall curve, f1 score etc.

## Natural Language Processing
![](https://github.com/sudhanshu2198/Machine-Learning-Python/blob/main/images/2.PNG)

Humans communicate with each other using words and text. The way that humans convey information to each other is called Natural Language. However, computers cannot interpret this data, which is in natural language, as they communicate in 1s and 0s. Natural Language Processing or NLP refers to the branch of Artificial Intelligence that gives the machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages. Project will be building a classifier achieving 92% accuracy on classifying jobs as fradulent or real using simple algorithm like Naive Bayes Algorithm.

## Time Series Analysis
![](https://github.com/sudhanshu2198/Machine-Learning-Python/blob/main/images/3.jpg)

Time-series forecasting is a technique that utilizes historical and current data to predict future values over a period of time or a specific point in the future. By analyzing data that we stored in the past, we can make informed decisions that can guide our business strategy and help us understand future trends. The main goal of this project electricity demand time series using SARIMA (Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) for medium term forcasts.

## Multi Class Classification Problem
![](https://github.com/sudhanshu2198/Machine-Learning-Python/blob/main/images/4.png)

Classification problems with more than two class labels are referred to as multi-class classification. Multiclass classification in machine learning, unlike binary classification, does not distinguish between normal and pathological results. Instead, examples are assigned to one of a number of pre-defined classes.

## Structured Query Language

The objective of this notebook is to do a rigorous analysis of Indian Premier League Database, answering multiple comman questions that cricketing fans have like top scorer, best Captain, best death over Specialist and many more. This notebook can be extremely helpful to people who knows and applied SQL on dummy database but want to practice on a Real Database, along with structured framework( where every query builds on previous queries) and questions to help them start. The notebook contains 30+ Advance queries covering nested case, aggregate, different types of join, group by and multiple table join.

## Statistical Hypothesis Testing
![](https://github.com/sudhanshu2198/Machine-Learning-Python/blob/main/images/6.png)

Hypothesis Testing is a type of statistical analysis in which you put your assumptions about a population parameter to the test. It is used to estimate the relationship between 2 statistical variables.
